		Hey. I'm interloop, some random guy who likes math a lot. Current goals include certain olympiads, Baby Rudin (Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Rudin), other books, et cetera.<br></br>
		I also read a lot of fiction and I do mean <i>a lot</i> and also manga and anime. Anime is currently on hold though, and I'm just reading manga (RIP Gojo anyone?) <br></br>
		Playing the piano and music in general is also one of my hobbies. Trinity Music exams have been on an indefinite hiatus since I was 11.<br></br>
		Oh yes, also squash.
