			My life right now is typing this thing but apparently that's not what I'm supposed to type here. <i>Apparently.</i> So yeah, my life right now revolves around math. Mostly all I do every day is math, which is fun, and coincidentally the same thing as the last sentence! <br></br>
			I just gave the second stage of my country's math olympiad about 2 weeks ago, and AMC on the 8th. Not too worried about qualifying either, but with the AMC leaks I'm a bit suspicious about the DHR (Distinction Honor Roll) cutoffs. Some people are saying AMC 12B (which is tomorrow) also got leaked, and I mean, what the heck. <br></br>
			Apart from Olympiad math (oh and I'm also in OTIS), I'm reading Rudin mostly on a regular basis, doing Algebraic Number Theory in a reading group in the <a href https://sophiefellowship.in/>Sophie Fellowship</a> and Abstract Algebra from Dummit-Foote/Gallian. <br></br>
			The only time (highly accurate) I go out is to play squash. <br></br>
			Hmm, what else. Oh yes, QOTD season has started (Math Olympiad Discord Server)! Hoping for Silver/Gold this season given that last season I got bronze. $$AWOGA$$
